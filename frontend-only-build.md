# Frontend-Only Deployment Solution

Since your Personal Finance Visualizer uses in-memory storage with pre-seeded sample data, we can deploy just the frontend as a static site. This is actually perfect for a demo/portfolio piece.

## Why Frontend-Only Works
- App uses in-memory storage (no database required)
- Sample data is pre-loaded (transactions, categories, budgets)
- All features work without a backend
- Perfect for showcasing your work

## Quick Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Netlify (Fastest)
1. Build frontend:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   vite build
   ```

2. Go to netlify.com
3. Drag and drop the `dist` folder
4. Live URL instantly!

### Option 2: Vercel (Manual)
1. Build frontend:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install  
   vite build
   ```

2. Upload `dist` folder to Vercel manually

### Option 3: GitHub Pages
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Use GitHub Actions to build and deploy

## Sample Data Included
Your deployed app will have:
- Sample transactions across different categories
- Pre-configured budgets
- Working charts and visualizations
- Full budget management features

This approach gives you a live demo URL without deployment complexity!
