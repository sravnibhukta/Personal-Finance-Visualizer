# ðŸš€ EASIEST DEPLOYMENT: Netlify

## 3 Simple Steps:

### Step 1: Get Your Code
1. Download/clone your project from GitHub
2. Or use the current Replit project

### Step 2: Build (Fix CSS First)
The build is failing due to CSS issues. Here's the fix:

**Option A: Skip Build (Use Development Version)**
1. Go to netlify.com
2. Create account (free)
3. Click "Deploy manually"
4. Upload your entire project folder (not just client)
5. Set build command: `npm run dev`
6. Set publish directory: `client/dist`

**Option B: Use GitHub + Netlify**
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to netlify.com
3. Connect GitHub repository
4. Set build command: `npm install && npm run build`
5. Set publish directory: `dist/public`
6. Deploy
